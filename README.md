# Distracted Driver Detector
A distracted driver detector that uses deep learning and makes a "beep" sound if the driver has been distracted for at least two seconds. Made for 2023 Ardenwood Elementary School Science and Engineering Fair (6th Grade).

## Dependencies (latest as of when this project was created)
### • Python 3.10 (3.11 was too new to support most of the following libraries)
### • PyTorch: torch 1.13.1, torchvision 0.14.1 for deep learning & image augumentation
### • Pillow (PIL) 9.4.0 for more image augumentation
### • OpenCV (cv2) 4.5.5.64 for the camera (4.7.0.68 didn't work on PyCharm)
### • Pygame 2.1.3dev8 for sounds

# Bugs and Issues
### • No bugs have been found so far. However, PLEASE USE THIS APPLICATION IN A CAR! Look at the data shown in the folders to find a good camera placement.

# Improvements
### • Put on a small device such as a Rasberry Pi and vibrate the steering wheel/seat instead of making an annoying sound.
